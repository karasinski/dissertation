\abstract{
  Augmented feedback has been shown to improve performance for a variety of simple and low-dimensional tasks, but more complex and realistic tasks are rarely explored in the literature.
  Compared to simply adding additional guidance, augmented feedback alerts operators to critical features of a task that they may otherwise not be aware of.
  Many forms of augmented feedback suffer from the guidance hypothesis, which manifests as decreased performance when the feedback is removed.
  This work explores a specific type of augmented feedback, called concurrent bandwidth feedback, and how it might be effectively applied to avoid the guidance hypothesis.
  Concurrent bandwidth feedback is provided to an operator in real-time, during task execution, when a specific signal deviates outside of an acceptable range of values.
  This ``Instructor Model'' of feedback highlights display elements that need urgent attention from the operator, and consequently appears less frequently as operator performance improves.
  Through the analysis of four human-in-the-loop experiments, we show that subjects that are exposed to concurrent bandwidth feedback dramatically and immediately improve task performance.
  Through varying the functional task complexity in an aircraft flight task, we show that the improvements in operator performance increase with increases in task complexity.
  By investigating immediate and 24-hour skill retention, we also show that concurrent bandwidth feedback does not cause the guidance hypothesis.
  While increasing performance usually results in higher levels of cognitive load, subjective workload measurements and objective secondary task performance indicates that our subjects did not experience additional cognitive load.
  Control theory-based modeling techniques were explored to further understand and predict the effects of concurrent bandwidth feedback.
  The Structural Model of the human pilot was extended to explain the increased task performance by introducing a new control block which models concurrent bandwidth feedback received by the operator.
  Using data from our aircraft flight task and the Structural Model, we show that exposure to the concurrent bandwidth feedback results in increased error sensing and gain compensation, raising the resultant crossover frequency and ultimately improving pilot performance.
  In all of our studies, subjects exposed to concurrent bandwidth feedback had higher levels of performance, did not experience increased workload, and did not suffer from the guidance hypothesis, indicating that concurrent bandwidth feedback can be used as an effective training technique for complex manual control tasks.
