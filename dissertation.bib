The years of research that preceded subscale selection and the weighted averaging approach resulted in a tool that has proven to be reasonably easy to use and reliably sensitive to experimentally important manipulations over the past 20 years. Its use has spread far beyond its original application (aviation), focus (crew complement), and language (English). This survey of 550 studies in which NASA-TLX was used or reviewed was undertaken to provide a resource for a new generation of users. The goal was to summarize the environments in which it has been applied, the types of activities the raters performed, other variables that were measured that did (or did not) covary, methodological issues, and lessons learned},

	abstract = {It is generally accepted that augmented feedback, provided by a human expert or a technical display, effectively enhances motor learning. However, discussion of the way to most effectively provide augmented feedback has been controversial. Related studies have focused primarily on simple or artificial tasks enhanced by visual feedback. Recently, technical advances have made it possible also to investigate more complex, realistic motor tasks and to implement not only visual, but also auditory, haptic, or multimodal augmented feedback. The aim of this review is to address the potential of augmented unimodal and multimodal feedback in the framework of motor learning theories. The review addresses the reasons for the different impacts of feedback strategies within or between the visual, auditory, and haptic modalities and the challenges that need to be overcome to provide appropriate feedback in these modalities, either in isolation or in combination. Accordingly, the design criteria for successful visual, auditory, haptic, and multimodal feedback are elaborated.},

Results from prior lunar lander experiments with variable levels of automation were replicated and extended to provide insights for the development of real-time metrics. Increased levels of automation resulted in increased flight performance, lower workload, and increased situational awareness. Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) was employed to detect verbal callouts as a limited measure of subjects' situational awareness. A one-dimensional manual tracking task and simple instructor-model visual feedback scheme was developed. This feedback was indicated to the operator by changing the color of a guidance element on the primary flight display, similar to how a flight instructor points out elements of a display to a student pilot. Experiments showed that for this low-complexity task, visual feedback did not change subject performance, but did increase the subjects' measured workload. Insights gained from these experiments were applied to a Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) inspection task. The effects of variations of an instructor-model performance-feedback strategy on human performance in a novel SAFER inspection task were investigated. Real-time feedback was found to have a statistically significant effect of improving subject performance and decreasing workload in this complicated four degree of freedom manual control task with two secondary tasks.},

	abstract = {Situation awareness (SA) can generally be defined as the pilot's mental model of the world around him. The ability of the pilot to maintain situation awareness has been recognized in the pilot community as crucial to mission success and survivability. Little empirical work has been done to explore this construct, however, as measurement techniques have been lacking. The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) was developed and validated as an objective measure of a pilot's situation awareness to meet this need. An investigation of the relationship between situation awareness and performance was conducted using SAGAT. The study evaluated the utility of situation awareness in a manned fighter sweep tactical mission using experienced pilot subjects. A total of 90 trials were conducted. The results support the importance of situation awareness for mission effectiveness. Blue Team subjects were almost twice as likely to later kill an aircraft when they had SA of that aircraft, as measured by SAGAT, than when they did not. The effect of rules of engagement, mission scenario, aircraft and weapons systems on the relationship between SA and performance is discussed.},

Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

The present study investigated whether the effects of low-level perceptual processing affect the redundancy gain by comparing the detection of onsets versus offsets. In different blocks, participants responded to left and right visual field stimuli that either appeared (onset) or disappeared (offset), with a single stimulus change in some trials and two redundant stimulus changes in others. With onset stimuli, the results replicated previous redundancy gain effects. In contrast, there was much less redundancy gain when participants responded to stimulus offsets. This finding suggests that redundancy gain is sensitive to low-level perceptual characteristics, such as onset versus offset presentation of stimuli.},

Therefore, multimodal systems must transition “gracefully,” meaning without unsafe decreases in flight performance or unacceptable changes in workload or situation awareness. Thirteen subjects flew a fixed base simulation of the NASA Constellation Program Altair lunar lander that transitioned from full autopilot to one of three flight-director-guided rate-command attitude hold manual control modes. After training, each subject flew 24 approaches, half of which included a landing point redesignation at the time of the mode transition requiring the pilot to null additional guidance errors. Bedford subjective workload and two-choice embedded secondary task response times were used to quantify temporal changes in mental workload. Situation awareness transients were detected by analysis of a tertiary task, verbal callouts of altitude, fuel, and terrain hazards. Graceful transitions were particularly difficult because Altair’s large inertia made the plant dynamics relatively sluggish. Transitions to manual control increased subjective and objective workloads and decreased callout accuracy in proportion to the number of flight control axes being manually commanded.},

	abstract = {The ability of operators to "gracefully transition" (maintaining control and awareness of the system without excessive workload or decrements in flight performance) between levels of automation (LOA) in several case studies and in a simulated lunar landing was investigated in anticipation of future lunar missions. Endsley's situation awareness model (extended to apply to supervisory control systems) and the Sheridan/Verplank and Proud/Hart LOA scales were used to analyze six maritime, aviation, and aerospace case studies and formulate design guidelines for enhancing mode transitions. These motivated an experiment in which thirteen subjects with flight simulator experience flew 24 approach trajectories (half including a landing point redesignation) that transitioned from a fully automatic flight control mode to either: pitch rate-control/attitude hold (RC/AH) with automatic rate-of-descent (ROD), roll-pitch-yaw (RPY) RC/AH with automatic ROD, or RPY RC/AH with incremental ROD. Subjective and objective workloads were measured using a Modified Bedford Scale and secondary task response time, respectively. A tertiary task - verbal callouts of altitude, fuel, and location, provided a measure of pilot situation awareness. Flight performance was evaluated using the pitch axis tracking error. Friedman pairwise tests demonstrated that secondary task response time significantly increased following the mode transition. Subjects' workload ratings, when ranked, showed unanimous agreement that workload was lowest prior to the transition, and highest during. The accuracy of the situation awareness verbal callouts decreased significantly after the transition. The immediate effect of redesignation was statistically concordant across subjects. Pitch axis tracking mean square error following a mode transition was greater in trials with redesignations (p = 0.0005), and increased consistently with control mode difficulty (p = 0.025) in runs with no redesignation, but not in runs with redesignations. Using callouts to assess the dynamics of situation awareness is a novel technique. Dramatic changes in subjective and objective workload and situation awareness occur after mode transitions, depending on control mode difficulty, that have an apparently reciprocal relationship. The case studies and experimental results suggested a dozen guidelines for design of supervisory control systems intended to promote transition gracefulness.},

The innermost loop controls the hand controller, the middle loop controls pitch rate, and the outer loop controls pitch angle. A human-in-the-loop simulation was conducted to gather data from a human pilot. Quantitative and qualitative metrics both indicate that the model is an acceptable fit to the human data. Fuel consumption was nearly identical; time to task completion matched very well. There is some evidence that the model responds faster to initial pitch rates than the human, artificially decreasing the model's time to task completion. This pilot model is descriptive, not predictive, of the human pilot. Insights are made into pilot behavior from this research. Symmetry implies that the human responds to positive and negative initial conditions with the same strategy. The human pilot appears indifferent to pitch angles within 0.5 deg, coasts at a constant pitch rate 1.09 deg/s, and has a reaction delay of 0.1 s.},

The paper compares the schemes' performance to each other and to practice alone without any form of guidance. The target-hitting task is represented in a visual and haptic virtual environment and implemented in a training protocol that lasts eleven sessions over a two-month period. The progressive guidance controller employs as inputs two expertise-based performance measures, trajectory error and input frequency. The analysis of the experimental results demonstrates that while guidance is active, haptic guidance outperforms both visual guidance and practice alone (no guidance) until late in the protocol when all three groups saturate at the same level of performance. The results fail to show significant differences in training outcomes because the performance of all participants saturates toward the end of the protocol. The key implication of the experimental findings is that visual and haptic guidance presented in a progressive manner have no detrimental effects on performance. Our results confirm that haptic guidance, based on skill component measures, is effective early in the training protocol when participants are only beginning to understand the components of the task but should be progressively removed to avoid possible negative dependence on the guidance.},

	abstract = {Modem complex aerospace systems employ flight deck automation to increase the efficiency and safety of systems while reducing operator workload. However, too much automation can lead to overtrust, complacency, and a decrease in operator situation awareness. In an attempt to prevent these from occurring, the operator and the automation often share responsibility for performing tasks. The tasks allocated to each agent are rarely fixed; instead, they can be dynamically re-allocated throughout operations based on the state of the operators, system, and environment. This thesis investigates how dynamic task re-allocation has been implemented in operational aerospace systems, and investigates the effect of control mode transitions on operator flying performance, visual attention, mental workload, and situation awareness through experimentation and simulation. This thesis reviews the dynamic task allocation literature and discusses the ways in which the concept can be implemented. It highlights adaptive automation, in which the dynamic re-allocation of tasks is initiated by the automation in a manner that is adaptive - in response to the state of the operator, system, and environment - and workload-balancing - with the purpose of keeping the operator in control as much as possible while remaining at a moderate level of mental workload. Adaptive automation is enthusiastically supported in the literature; however, for reasons discussed, it has not been deployed in any operational civilian aerospace system. In the experiment, twelve subjects sat at a fixed-base lunar landing simulator and initiated transitions between automatic and two manual control modes. Visual fixations were recorded with an eye tracker, and subjects' mental workload and situation awareness were measured using the responses to a secondary two-choice response task and a tertiary task of verbal call-outs of the vehicle state, respectively. Subjects were found to re-allocate attention according to the priority of tasks: during mode transitions from autopilot to two-axis manual control the percent of total attention on the attitude indicator (which was required for the primary flying task) increased 14\% while attention on instruments required for the secondary and tertiary tasks decreased 5\%. Subjects' conception of task priority appeared to be influenced by instructions given during training and top-down and bottom-up properties of the tasks and instrument displays. The attention allocation was also affected by the frequency of control inputs required. The percent of attention on the attitude indicator decreased up to 13\% across mode transitions where the flying task was not re-allocated because the pitch guidance rate-of-change decreased from -9 to 0 °/s throughout the trial. Consequently, fewer control inputs and less attention were necessary later in the trial. An integrated human-vehicle model was developed to simulate how operators allocate attention in the lunar landing task and the effect this has on flying performance, mental workload, and situation awareness. The human performance model describes how operators make estimates of the system states, correct these estimates by attending and perceiving information from the displays, and use these estimates to control the vehicle. A new attention parameter - the uncertainty in operators' estimates of system states between visual fixations - was developed that directly relates attention and situation awareness. The model's attention block was validated against experimental data, demonstrating an average difference in the percent of attention {\textless}/-3.6\% for all instruments. The model's predictions of flying performance, mental workload, and situation awareness were also qualitatively compared to experimental data.},

	abstract = {Future complex systems, such as those found in piloted aircraft and spacecraft, will undoubtedly utilize significant automation to enhance pilot capabilities and enable novel mission scenarios. Off-nominal conditions may arise, such as failures of automation or other systems, and the ability of a pilot to quickly synthesize the presented state or system status information to detect failures might ultimately influence pilot safety and mission success. This thesis focuses on the performance of a single pilot performing a high workload, time critical, lunar landing task and aims to: 1) quantify the pilots' ability to detect different system failures in various control modes either with or without motion cues, 2) determine how pilots' visual attention changes in different control modes and just before detecting failures, and 3) create a failure detection model within a closed-loop human-vehicle model. In a first experiment, experienced aircraft pilots (n=14) were trained to fly a NASA lunar landing simulator equipped with a large amplitude motion system and to detect a thruster stuck firing, a noisy flight director, or a fuel leak. Each pilot's failure detection performance, mental workload, and situation awareness was then quantified experimentally. Surprisingly, the presence of motion did not affect the time needed for pilots to detect failures - even with failures that had a motion component - when compared to trials without motion. Detection time did, however, depend on both the type of failure and the number of flight axes being manually controlled. Mental workload and situation awareness monotonically degraded with the number of control axes, and further degraded when pilots had to detect failures. In a second experiment, pilots (n=12) flew a fixed-base lunar landing simulator with a similar scenario and system failures. An eye tracker was used to record the number of fixations on various display areas and their average duration. Visual dwell durations were found to increase on the display areas where failure cues appeared prior to the pilot's report that a failure had been detected. This suggests that failure detection is a two-step process: pilots first notice a conflict between actual and expected instrument indications, and then confirm the observation by closely monitoring those instruments before reporting a failure. In addition, it was shown that after pilots transitioned from autopilot to manual control, as expected, attention shifted from supervisory display elements to include elements relevant for manual control. However, increased attention on these instruments used for manual control did not result in faster detection of failure cues that appeared on them. A human failure detection model was developed within a closed-loop, human performance model. A vehicle model was added in order to represent the entire human-machine system. Failure detection was modeled as a two-step process as implied by the second experiment. A mental model was developed to calculate the pilot's internal estimate of system states and attention was simulated as a first-order Markov process. By modifying a threshold within each of the detector's two stages, failure detection simulated by the model was closely correlated (i.e. within two seconds in most cases) to the results of the first experiment. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed on select model parameters to investigate their effect on failure detection. This research found that pilot's ability to detect failures quickly during simulated lunar landing depends on both the vehicle control mode and the failure cues. Small deviations in detection time during time-critical tasks can have a large impact on mission outcome. A human failure detection model was developed to model failure detection and, once further developed and validated, can be useful in predicting human behavior in future vehicles.},

This mobile procedure viewer allows for just-in-time training using holograms to provide contextually relevant information to novice or out of practice users. We summarize a first look at best practices and guidelines for augmented reality assisted procedure execution from user testing conducted at NASA Ames Research Center.},

	abstract = {Robust remote teleoperation of high-DOF manipulators is of critical importance across a wide range of robotics applications. Contemporary robot manipulation interfaces primarily utilize a free-positioning pose specification approach to independently control each axis of translation and orientation in free space. In this work, we present two novel interfaces, constrained positioning and point-and-click, which incorporate scene information, including points-of-interest and local surface geometry, into the grasp specification process. We also present results of a user study evaluation comparing the effects of increased use of scene information in grasp pose specification algorithms for general object manipulation. The results of our study show that constrained positioning and point-and-click significantly outperform the widely used free positioning approach by significantly reducing the number of grasping errors and the number of user interactions required to specify poses. Furthermore, the point-and-click interface significantly increased the number of tasks users were able to complete.},

Monoscopic perspective projection alone is usually not sufficient to represent three-dimensional spatial information. It can, however, be improved by the adjustment of perspective parameters and by geometric visual enhancements such as reference lines and a background grid. Stereoscopic display is another method of providing three-dimensional information to the human operator. Two experiments are performed with three-axis manual tracking tasks. The first experiment investigates the effects of perspective parameters on tracking performance. The second experiment investigates the effects of visual enhancements for both monoscopic and stereoscopic displays. Results indicate that, though stereoscopic displays do generally permit superior tracking performance, monoscopic displays can allow equivalent performance when they are defined with optimal perspective parameters and provided with adequate visual enhancements.},

However, careful consideration is necessary to display three-dimensional information on a two-dimensional screen effectively. A teleoperation simulator is constructed with a vector display system, joysticks, and a simulated cylindrical manipulator to evaluate various display conditions quantitatively. Pick-and-place tasks are performed, and mean completion times are used as a performance measure. Two experiments are performed. First, effects of variation of perspective parameters on human operator's pick-and-place performance with monoscopic perspective display are investigated. Then visual enhancements of monoscopic perspective display by adding a grid and reference lines are investigated and compared with visual enhancements of stereoscopic display. The results indicate that stereoscopic display does generally permit superior pick-and-place performance, while monoscopic display can allow equivalent performance when it is defined with appropriate perspective parameter values and provided with adequate visual enhancements. Mean completion time results of pick-and-place experiments for various display conditions shown are observed to be quite similar to the normalized rms error results of mannal tracking experiments reported previously.},

The experiment showed that the spatial ability of an operator—as reflected by a test battery of two spatial recognition and two spatial manipulation tests—was significantly correlated with the ability to teleoperate the robot through a maze. Surprisingly, providing different combinations of visual, auditory, and vibrotactile feedback to the operator did not significantly change performance. However, there was an interaction between spatial ability and feedback condition that affected teleoperation performance.},

Space robot systems and on-orbit telerobotics technology will play an essential role in the construction and maintenance of large scale structures, such as the International Space Station (ISS), but it is well known that in Earth orbit space applications the total cycle time is usually of 7 s. Many proposals have appeared in the literature through the years on how to conduct time delayed teleoperation, but to date no comprehensive comparison study between them has been carried out. In this context, it was decided to conduct a survey of all proposals for time-delayed teleoperation present so far in the literature and compare them on the same grounds. This will give researchers in this field a better understanding of the problem and will help them have a clear view as to in what areas more research is needed to achieve continuous and smooth teleoperation in the presence of time delay. This study focused on the continuous teleoperation of robotic arms on orbit around the Earth. This will be the area of space robotics applications with the greater demand in the following years. Special emphasis has been put throughout the study on the specific operational characteristics of this type of systems. Finally, a framework for future research in the field have been proposed. The framework is based on the definition of a nomenclature and a data flow diagram in which to express in a concise and compact way different algorithms. The utility of this framework is demonstrated both with a general example and with its application to different proposals present in the literature.},

KR is defined as augmented feedback, where the KR is additional to those sources of feedback that are naturally received when a response is made. Transfer tests, usually under no-KR conditions, are essential for unraveling the temporary effects of KR manipulations from their relatively permanent learning effects. When this is considered, the literature reveals findings that produce reasonable agreement, although there are a number of inconsistencies in studies examining the same variables. When learning vs performance effects of KR are separated, a number of contradictions occur; new principles that emerge include the notion that KR acts as guidance, that it is motivating or energizing, and that it has a role in the formation of associations. It is suggested that KR may guide an S to the proper target behavior, with other processes (e.g., simple repetition) being the critical determinants of learning.

It overcomes limitations of Donders' and more recent methods, and permits the discovery of stages, assessment of their properties, and separate testing of the additivity and stochastic independence of stage durations. The main feature of the additive-factor method is the search for non-interacting effects of experimental factors on mean RT. The method is applied to several binary-classification experiments, where it leads to a four-stage model, and to an identification experiment, where it distinguishes two stages. The sets of stages inferred from both these and other data are shown to carry substantive implications. It is demonstrated that stage-durations may be additive without being stochastically independent, a result that is relevant to the formulation of mathematical models of RT.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999PhDT.......306S},
	abstract = {Many fields of endeavor require humans to conduct manual control tasks
while viewing a perspective scene. Manual control refers to tasks in
which continuous, or nearly continuous, control adjustments are
required. Examples include flying an aircraft, driving a car, and riding
a bicycle. Perspective scenes can arise through natural viewing of the
world, simulation of a scene (as in flight simulators), or through
imaging devices (such as the cameras on an unmanned aerospace vehicle).
Designers frequently have some degree of control over the content and
characteristics of a perspective scene; airport designers can choose
runway markings, vehicle designers can influence the size and shape of
windows, as well as the location of the pilot, and simulator database
designers can choose scene complexity and content. Little theoretical
framework exists to help designers determine the answers to questions
related to perspective scene content. An empirical approach is most
commonly used to determine optimum perspective scene configurations. The
goal of the research effort described in this dissertation has been to
provide a tool for modeling the characteristics of human operators
conducting manual control tasks with perspective-scene viewing. This is
done for the purpose of providing an algorithmic, as opposed to
empirical, method for analyzing the effects of changing perspective
scene content for closed-loop manual control tasks. The dissertation
contains the development of a model of manual control using a
perspective scene, called the Visual Cue Control (VCC) Model. Two forms
of model were developed: one model presumed that the operator obtained
both position and velocity information from one visual cue, and the
other model presumed that the operator used one visual cue for position,
and another for velocity. The models were compared and validated in two
experiments. The results show that the two-cue VCC model accurately
characterizes the output of the human operator with a variety of
perspective scenes. The potential of using the model for visual cue
identification was also investigated, with promising results. A third
experiment was performed to compare perspective displays with more
conventional display types.},

These results indicate the diagnostic value of the task in discriminating between the perceptual/central processing and response demands of a holding pattern and an approach pattern, respectively. Perceptual and response load were greater in an approach phase, relative to a holding phase. Neither phase imposed a substantial central processing load. Based upon the findings of the studies described, the paper concludes with a set of recommendations for employing the Sternberg task in aviation environments.

	abstract = {To answer the question: “what is 3D good for?” we reviewed the body of literature concerning the performance implications of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) displays versus non-stereo (2D or monoscopic) displays. We summarized results of over 160 publications describing over 180 experiments spanning 51years of research in various fields including human factors psychology/engineering, human–computer interaction, vision science, visualization, and medicine. Publications were included if they described at least one task with a performance-based experimental evaluation of an S3D display versus a non-stereo display under comparable viewing conditions. We classified each study according to the experimental task(s) of primary interest: (a) judgments of positions and/or distances; (b) finding, identifying, or classifying objects; (c) spatial manipulations of real or virtual objects; (d) navigation; (e) spatial understanding, memory, or recall and (f) learning, training, or planning. We found that S3D display viewing improved performance over traditional non-stereo (2D) displays in 60\% of the reported experiments. In 15\% of the experiments, S3D either showed a marginal benefit or the results were mixed or unclear. In 25\% of experiments, S3D displays offered no benefit over non-stereo 2D viewing (and in some rare cases, harmed performance). From this review, stereoscopic 3D displays were found to be most useful for tasks involving the manipulation of objects and for finding/identifying/classifying objects or imagery. We examine instances where S3D did not support superior task performance. We discuss the implications of our findings with regard to various fields of research concerning stereoscopic displays within the context of the investigated tasks.},

The basic perceptual cues used to perceive the third(depth) dimension are first described, and empirical data bearing on the interaction between these cues are discussed. Generally, when more depth cues are present, a proportionately more salient sense of depth is conveyed. But this additive model breaks down when motion is involved. It is concluded that stereopsis motion, and occlusion are particularly salient cues. Techniques for implementing perspective and stereoptic displays are then described. This discussion is followed by a review of 3 display technology applications in the following areas: flight deck displays, air traffic control, meteorology, teleoperation, and computer graphics. Where available, studies are discussed which contrast the efficacy of 3D with 2D representations. In both laboratory and field studies, it appears that the usefulness of stereopsis is diminished and may vanish altogether when displays are dynamic.},

	abstract = {Once considered too processing-intense for general utility, application of the third dimension to convey complex information is facilitated by the recent proliferation of technological advancements in computer processing, 3D displays, and 3D perspective (2.5D) renderings within a 2D medium. The profusion of complex and rapidly-changing dynamic information being conveyed in operational environments has elevated interest in possible military applications of 3D technologies. 3D can be a powerful mechanism for clearer information portrayal, facilitating rapid and accurate identification of key elements essential to mission performance and operator safety. However, implementation of 3D within legacy systems can be costly, making integration prohibitive. Therefore, identifying which tasks may benefit from 3D or 2.5D versus simple 2D visualizations is critical. Unfortunately, there is no "bible" of human factors guidelines for usability optimization of 2D, 2.5D, or 3D visualizations nor for determining which display best serves a particular application. Establishing such guidelines would provide an invaluable tool for designers and operators. Defining issues common to each will enhance design effectiveness. This paper presents the results of an extensive review of open source literature addressing 3D information displays, with particular emphasis on comparison of true 3D with 2D and 2.5D representations and their utility for military tasks. Seventy-five papers are summarized, highlighting militarily relevant applications of 3D visualizations and 2.5D perspective renderings. Based on these findings, human factors guidelines for when and how to use these visualizations, along with recommendations for further research are discussed.},

Previous research shows that perspective displays support better performance than plan-view displays on navigation, spatial awareness, and integration tasks. However, several issues need to be carefully considered and understood before perspective displays may be safely operationalised.

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) perspective view displays are being developed for naval air warfare consoles. Because of the inherent ambiguities of perspective projection and the lack of depth cues available in flat-screen 3-D displays, it is difficult to correctly identify the position of tracks. Our objective was to test the potential performance benefits of adding depth cues and other augmentations to 3-D displays to improve track localization. Participants viewed tracks in augmented 3-D displays or a two-dimensional (2-D) top-down display, and then reconstructed track positions on blank paper maps with track symbol pins. We found the following: Drop-lines and drop-shadows significantly improved the localization of aircraft over no augmentations for 3-D displays. Augmenting 3-D displays with drop-lines and drop-shadows improved ground-plane localization performance to the level of 2-D displays. Drop-lines led to the best overall localization performance for 3-D displays. Varying the size of track symbols with distance for 3-D displays improved localization only when there were no drop-lines or drop-shadows present.},

As an introduction to such models, elementary concepts and specific physical examples are used to set the stage for a step-by-step development of what is known about the human pilot as a dynamic control component. In the process, quasi-linear models for single-loop systems with visual stimuli and multiloop systems with visual stimuli are presented and then extended to cover multiloop, multi-modality situtations. Empirical connections between the pilot dynamics and pilot ratings are also considered. Some of the most important nonlinear features of human pilot behavior in adapting to changes in the character of the stimuli are described and tied to the quasi-linear models.},

This paper presents a review of control models for human pilot behavior. The purposes of the models are to analyze the characteristics of the pilot-aircraft system, and to provide valuable guidance in the flight control system design. Existing human pilot models are classified into three types. The first category of models, based on control theory, can only be used to describe the control functions of human pilot. The typical models include McRuer quasi-linear models and optimal control models. Then the principle of human pilot control behavior was revealed from the physiological perspective, the Hess structural model being the most common one. Hosman's descriptive model and biodynamic model are also summarized. The paper also proposes that the development of artificial intelligence technology has enabled the study of nonlinear characteristics of pilot behavior in manual control. Models based on intelligence techniques are briefly introduced, e.g., fuzzy control models, neural network models. Finally, the paper outlines several typical and future applications of the techniques in the pilot modeling field. However, as the presented discussion is limited to a small area of pilot modeling, many other challenges remain open for further research and development.},

The situation considered is that for which the dynamical system being tracked is linear and is perturbed by an external white noise input. By assuming that the human behaves “optimally” in some sense, subject to his inherent psychophysical limitations, a quantitative model is developed for the response characteristics of the human operator. The resultant suboptimal model can be used to predict task performance, measured human controller describing functions, remnant and power spectra. The model is described in detail and is used to predict experimentally measured quantities for three simple, but basic, compensatory tracking tasks.

Résumé
L'article applique la théorie de l'estimation et de la commande optimales à une large catégorie de problèmes de commande manuelle. La situation considérée est celle pour laquelle le système dynamique poursuivi est linéaire et se trouve perturbé par une entrée extérieure de bruit blanc. En supposant que l'être humain se comporte d'une manière “optimale” dans un certain sens, étant assujetti à ses limitations psycho-physiologiques inhérentes, l'article établit un modèle quantitatif des caractéristiques de reponse de l'opérateur humain. Le modèle suboptimal qui en résulte peut être utilisé pour la prediction des performances de tâches, des fonctions descriptives mésurées du régulateur humain et des spectres de puissance. Le modèle est décrit en détail et il est utilisé pour prédire des quantités expérimentalement measurées pour trois cas, simples mais fondamentaux, de tâches de poursuite à compensation. Dans un article parallèle, le modèle est appliqué à l'étude d'une tâche complexe de vol plané à decollage et à atterrissage verticaux.
Zusammenfassung
Eine Anwendung der Theorie der optimalen Regelung und Schätzung wurde für eine breite Klasse von Handregelungsproblemen vorgenommen. Die betrachtete Situation ist dadurch gekennzeichnet, daß das dynamische System linear und durch äußeres weißes Rauschen gestört ist. Unter der Annahme, daß sich der Mensch in gewissem Sinne, obwohl von Natur aus seinen psychophysischen Begrenzungen unterworfen, “optimal” verhält, wird ein quantitatives Modell für die Empfindlichkeitskurve des menschlichen Operators entwickelt. Das resultierende suboptimale Modell kann benutzt werden, um die Durchführung der Aufgabe, die gemessenen, den menschlichen Regler beschreibenden Funktionen, die Rest- und Leistungsspektren vorherzusagen. Das Modell wird im einzelnen beschrieben und wird benutzt, um experimentell gemessene Größen für drei einfache, aber grundlegende Verkettungsaufgaben vorherzusagen. In einer weiteren Arbeit wird das Modell bemüht, um ein komplexes Hubschraubermodell zu studieren.

In this perception process both the visual and the vestibular systems play an important role. To understand this perception process and its impact on a pilot's control behavior a descriptive model was developed. The single-channel information-processor model was applied as the basic structure of the final model. Three groups of experiments were performed to refine the model structure and to define the majority of the model parameters. The model has been evaluated by measuring the control behavior in tracking tasks.},

	abstract = {Biodynamic models may: (i) represent understanding of how the body moves (i.e., `mechanistic models'), (ii) summarise biodynamic measurements (i.e., `quantitative models'), and (iii) provide predictions of the effects of motion on human health, comfort or performance (i.e., `effects models'). Model validation may involve consideration of evidence used to derive a model, comparison of the model with alternatives, and a comparison between model predictions and independent observations of the predicted qualities or quantities. Models should be associated with a specified range of independent and dependent variables and indicate how intra-subject variability and inter-subject variability are accommodated. Models of the mechanisms of body movement may be validated by demonstrations that the mechanisms are well represented. Models giving numerical predictions (`quantitative models' and `effects models') should specify the expected accuracy of predictions. `Effects models' advocated for predicting health, comfort or performance require that: (i) vibration or shock is a proven cause of the specified effect, (ii) within all reasonable ranges of model inputs, there must be reason to expect a positive correlation and acceptable error between the model predictions and the effect, (iii) other variables having a large influence on the effect must be taken into consideration. It is more useful to report the accuracy of `quantitative models' and `effects models' models than to state that they are `validated' or `un-validated'. Checklists for assessing the quality of a biodynamic model are proposed, taking into account the type of model and the model assertions, the evidence, the assumptions, the accuracy, and the appropriateness of the model.Relevance Biodynamic models can be used to predict risks of injury or disease. Models can be used to optimise designs in order to minimise predicted risks. However, models can be promulgated and used without knowledge of their accuracy or usefulness.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the state of the art in human/operator modeling. The thrust of such a conspectus is towards describing the ongoing research as well as some future possible applications resulting from the research, which are currently under investigation at the ManMachine System Laboratory at SUNY, Binghamton. The paper contains a brief description of conventional human operator models, such as: the Crossover Model, the Hess Structural Model, and the Optimal Control Model (OCM). Current trends in operator modeling are presented in this paper by work done by Zeyada and Hess at UCLA Davis and Hosman at Delft. The major element of the Zeyada and Hess research is that they extensively utilize intelligent computing tools such as Fuzzy Inference Systems and Genetic algorithms, along with conventional tools for operator modeling. The emphasis, however, of this section of the paper is on a description of the work done by Gary George and Frank Cardullo. Their research is primarily based on major modifications to the existing Hess model by adding the vestibular and somatosensory stimulation channels into the feedback of the model, for the purpose of evaluating the contribution of simulator cueing devices to operator behavior. The vestibular stimulation channel contains models of the vestibular system, a motion platform and motion washouts. The somatosensory cueing channel contains a model of the Pacinian corpuscles a dynamic seat and its drive algorithm. The state-of-the-art research section of the conspectus represents the work done by Zaychik and Cardullo. The main thrust of this work is the development of a methodology of automated tuning of the parameters of the modified Hess model. The proposed algorithm heavily involves machine learning tools sometimes known as soft computing techniques. The automatic tuning of the model allows for the real-time identification of a model of the operator of a vehicle. The paper contains the description of potential application in the area of flight safety as well as simulator/handling qualities evaluation.},

	abstract = {In this study, behavioral models are developed that closely reproduced pulsive control response of two pilots from the experimental pool using markedly different control techniques  while conducting a tracking task. An intriguing find was that the pilots appeared to: 1) produce a continuous, internally-generated stick signal that they integrated in time; 2) integrate the actual stick position; and 3) compare the two integrations to issue and cease pulse commands. This suggests that the pilots utilized kinesthetic feedback in order to perceive and integrate stick position, supporting the hypothesis that pilots can access and employ the proprioceptive inner feedback loop proposed by Hess' pilot Structural Model. The Pulse Models used in conjunction with the pilot Structural Model closely recreated the pilot data both in the frequency and time domains during closed-loop simulation. This indicates that for the range of tasks and control styles encountered, the models captured the fundamental mechanisms governing pulsive and control processes. The pilot Pulse Models give important insight for the amount of remnant  that arises from nonlinear pilot technique, and for the remaining remnant arising from different sources unrelated to tracking control .},

	abstract = {A control-theoretic model of the human pilot as an adaptive element in a flight control system is presented. An earlier version of the model has been discussed in the literature for use with single-axis linear, vehicle system descriptions, including an application to a two-axis task with a linear vehicle model. The current study expands the model’s applicability to multiaxis, nonlinear systems. Three illustrative examples are presented: 1) a single-axis control problem with a transfer function description of the controlled-element dynamics; 2) a two-axis flight control problem involving a linear, highly coupled rotorcraft model including fundamental rotor degrees of freedom; and 3) a two-axis flight control problem involving a nonlinear, coupled aircraft model with dynamics patterned after the subscale NASA Langley Research Center’s Generic Transport Model. The ability of the refined adaptive pilot model to accommodate significant and sudden variations in elements of the flight control system, as well as departed flight, is demonstrated through computer simulation. Particular attention is paid to ensuring that the adapted pilot model obeys the dictates of the crossover model of the human pilot, before and after adaptation. A brief human-in-the-loop tracking study via a desktop simulation of the single-axis task is included in the study. Potential applications of the adaptive pilot model include the evaluation of adaptive flight control structures and evaluation of aircraft loss-of-control events.},

This survey is organized around four potential benefits of the Cloud: 1) Big Data: access to libraries of images, maps, trajectories, and descriptive data; 2) Cloud Computing: access to parallel grid computing on demand for statistical analysis, learning, and motion planning; 3) Collective Robot Learning: robots sharing trajectories, control policies, and outcomes; and 4) Human Computation: use of crowdsourcing to tap human skills for analyzing images and video, classification, learning, and error recovery. The Cloud can also improve robots and automation systems by providing access to: a) datasets, publications, models, benchmarks, and simulation tools; b) open competitions for designs and systems; and c) open-source software.

	abstract = {Recent advances in technology are delivering robots of reduced size and cost. A natural outgrowth of these advances are systems comprised of large numbers of robots that collaborate autonomously in diverse applications. Research on effective autonomous control of such systems, commonly called swarms, has increased dramatically in recent years and received attention from many domains, such as bioinspired robotics and control theory. These kinds of distributed systems present novel challenges for the effective integration of human supervisors, operators, and teammates that are only beginning to be addressed. This paper is the first survey of human-swarm interaction (HSI) and identifies the core concepts needed to design a human-swarm system. We first present the basics of swarm robotics. Then, we introduce HSI from the perspective of a human operator by discussing the cognitive complexity of solving tasks with swarm systems. Next, we introduce the interface between swarm and operator and identify challenges and solutions relating to human-swarm communication, state estimation and visualization, and human control of swarms. For the latter, we develop a taxonomy of control methods that enable operators to control swarms effectively. Finally, we synthesize the results to highlight remaining challenges, unanswered questions, and open problems for HSI, as well as how to address them in future works.},

	abstract = {Autonomy is a critical construct related to human-robot interaction (HRI) and varies widely across robot platforms. Levels of robot autonomy (LORA), ranging from teleoperation to fully autonomous systems, influence the way in which humans and robots interact with one another. Thus, there is a need to understand HRI by identifying variables that influence---and are influenced by---robot autonomy. Our overarching goal is to develop a framework for LORA in HRI. To reach this goal, our framework draws links between HRI and human-automation interaction, a field with a long history of studying and understanding human-related variables. The construct of autonomy is reviewed and redefined within the context of HRI. Additionally, this framework proposes a process for determining a robot's autonomy level by categorizing autonomy along a 10-point taxonomy. The framework is intended to be treated as a guideline for determining autonomy, categorizing the LORA along a qualitative taxonomy and considering HRI variables (e.g., acceptance, situation awareness, reliability) that may be influenced by the LORA.},

Given the impact of trust observed in other systems, trust in the robot team member will likely be critical to effective and safe performance. Our thesis for this paper is that trust in a robot team member must be appropriately calibrated rather than simply maximized.  We describe how the human team member’s understanding of the system contributes to trust in human-robot teaming, by evoking mental model theory. We discuss how mental models are related to physical and behavioral characteristics of the robot, on the one hand, and affective and behavioral outcomes, such as trust and system use/disuse/misuse, on the other.  We expand upon our discussion by providing recommendations for best practices in human-robot team research and design and other systems using artificial intelligence.},

	abstract = {Recently, the concept of human-robot collaboration has raised many research interests. Instead of robots replacing human workers in workplaces, human-robot collaboration allows human workers and robots working together in a shared manufacturing environment. Human-robot collaboration can release human workers from heavy tasks with assistive robots if effective communication channels between humans and robots are established. Although the communication channels between human workers and robots are still limited, gesture recognition has been effectively applied as the interface between humans and computers for long time. Covering some of the most important technologies and algorithms of gesture recognition, this paper is intended to provide an overview of the gesture recognition research and explore the possibility to apply gesture recognition in human-robot collaborative manufacturing. In this paper, an overall model of gesture recognition for human-robot collaboration is also proposed. There are four essential technical components in the model of gesture recognition for human-robot collaboration: sensor technologies, gesture identification, gesture tracking and gesture classification. Reviewed approaches are classified according to the four essential technical components. Statistical analysis is also presented after technical analysis. Towards the end of this paper, future research trends are outlined.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research was to assess the effectiveness of adaptive automation (AA) for supporting information processing (IP) in a complex, dynamic control task by defining a measure of situation awareness (SA) sensitive to differences in the forms of automation. The task was an air traffic control (ATC)-related simulation and was developed to present four different modes of automation of IP functions, including information acquisition, information analysis, decision making and action implementation automation, as well as a completely manual control mode. A total of 16 participants were recruited for a pilot study and primary experiment. The pilot assessed the sensitivity and reliability of the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) for describing AA support of the IP functions. Half of the participants were used in the primary experiment, which refined the SA measure and described the implications of AA for IP on SA using the ATC-like simulation. Participants were exposed to all forms of automation and manual control. AA conditions matched operator workload states to dynamic control allocations in the primary task. The pilot did not reveal significant differences in SA among the various AA conditions. In the primary experiment, participant recall of aircraft was cued and relevance weights were assigned to aircraft at the time of simulation freezes. The modified measure of SA revealed operator perception and Total SA to improve when automation was applied to the information acquisition function. In both experiments, performance in the ATC-related task simulation was significantly superior when automation was applied to information acquisition and action implementation (sensory and motor processing), as compared to automation of cognitive functions, specifically information analysis. The primary experiment revealed information analysis and decision-making automation to cause higher workload, attributable to visual demands of displays.
Industry relevance

	abstract = {As robotic devices are applied to problems beyond traditional manufacturing and industrial settings, we find that interaction between robots and humans, especially physical interaction, has become a fast developing field. Consider the application of robotics in healthcare, where we find telerobotic devices in the operating room facilitating dexterous surgical procedures, exoskeletons in the rehabilitation domain as walking aids and upper-limb movement assist devices, and even robotic limbs that are physically integrated with amputees who seek to restore their independence and mobility. In each of these scenarios, the physical coupling between human and robot, often termed physical human robot interaction (pHRI), facilitates new human performance capabilities and creates an opportunity to explore the sharing of task execution and control between humans and robots. In this review, we provide a unifying view of human and robot sharing task execution in scenarios where collaboration and cooperation between the two entities are necessary, and where the physical coupling of human and robot is a vital aspect. We define three key themes that emerge in these shared control scenarios, namely, intent detection, arbitration, and feedback. First, we explore methods for how the coupled pHRI system can detect what the human is trying to do, and how the physical coupling itself can be leveraged to detect intent. Second, once the human intent is known, we explore techniques for sharing and modulating control of the coupled system between robot and human operator. Finally, we survey methods for informing the human operator of the state of the coupled system, or the characteristics of the environment with which the pHRI system is interacting. At the conclusion of the survey, we present two case studies that exemplify shared control in pHRI systems, and specifically highlight the approaches used for the three key themes of intent detection, arbitration, and feedback for applications of upper limb robotic rehabilitation and haptic feedback from a robotic prosthesis for the upper limb.},

In this paper, we present a systematic review on the reported adaptive interactions across a number of domain areas during Human-Robot Interaction and also give future directions that can guide the design of future adaptive social robots. We conjecture that this will help towards achieving long-term applicability of robots in various social domains.},

	abstract = {As computers become more pervasive in society, facilitating natural human–computer interaction (HCI) will have a positive impact on their use. Hence, there has been growing interest in the development of new approaches and technologies for bridging the human–computer barrier. The ultimate aim is to bring HCI to a regime where interactions with computers will be as natural as an interaction between humans, and to this end, incorporating gestures in HCI is an important research area. Gestures have long been considered as an interaction technique that can potentially deliver more natural, creative and intuitive methods for communicating with our computers. This paper provides an analysis of comparative surveys done in this area. The use of hand gestures as a natural interface serves as a motivating force for research in gesture taxonomies, its representations and recognition techniques, software platforms and frameworks which is discussed briefly in this paper. It focuses on the three main phases of hand gesture recognition i.e. detection, tracking and recognition. Different application which employs hand gestures for efficient interaction has been discussed under core and advanced application domains. This paper also provides an analysis of existing literature related to gesture recognition systems for human computer interaction by categorizing it under different key parameters. It further discusses the advances that are needed to further improvise the present hand gesture recognition systems for future perspective that can be widely used for efficient human computer interaction. The main goal of this survey is to provide researchers in the field of gesture based HCI with a summary of progress achieved to date and to help identify areas where further research is needed.},

	abstract = {A person's emotions and state of mind are apparent in their face and eyes. As a Latin proverb states: ‘The face is the portrait of the mind; the eyes, its informers’. This presents a significant challenge for Computer Graphics researchers who generate artificial entities that aim to replicate the movement and appearance of the human eye, which is so important in human–human interactions. This review article provides an overview of the efforts made on tackling this demanding task. As with many topics in computer graphics, a cross-disciplinary approach is required to fully understand the workings of the eye in the transmission of information to the user. We begin with a discussion of the movement of the eyeballs, eyelids and the head from a physiological perspective and how these movements can be modelled, rendered and animated in computer graphics applications. Furthermore, we present recent research from psychology and sociology that seeks to understand higher level behaviours, such as attention and eye gaze, during the expression of emotion or during conversation. We discuss how these findings are synthesized in computer graphics and can be utilized in the domains of Human–Robot Interaction and Human–Computer Interaction for allowing humans to interact with virtual agents and other artificial entities. We conclude with a summary of guidelines for animating the eye and head from the perspective of a character animator.},

	abstract = {We interact daily with computers that appear and behave like humans. Some researchers propose that people apply the same social norms to computers as they do to humans, suggesting that social psychological knowledge can be applied to our interactions with computers. In contrast, theories of human–automation interaction postulate that humans respond to machines in unique and specific ways. We believe that anthropomorphism—the degree to which an agent exhibits human characteristics—is the critical variable that may resolve this apparent contradiction across the formation, violation, and repair stages of trust. Three experiments were designed to examine these opposing viewpoints by varying the appearance and behavior of automated agents. Participants received advice that deteriorated gradually in reliability from a computer, avatar, or human agent. Our results showed (a) that anthropomorphic agents were associated with greater trust resilience, a higher resistance to breakdowns in trust; (b) that these effects were magnified by greater uncertainty; and c) that incorporating human-like trust repair behavior largely erased differences between the agents. Automation anthropomorphism is therefore a critical variable that should be carefully incorporated into any general theory of human–agent trust as well as novel automation design.

	abstract = {Universal usability is an important component of HCI, particularly as companies promote their products in increasingly global markets to users with diverse cultural backgrounds. Successful anthropomorphic agents must have appropriate computer etiquette and nonverbal communication patterns. Because there are differences in etiquette, tone, formality, and colloquialisms across different user populations, it is unlikely that a generic anthropomorphic agent would be universally appealing. Additionally, because anthropomorphic characters are depicted as capable of human reasoning and possessing human motivations, users may ascribe undue trust in these agents. Trust is a complex construct that exerts an important role in a user’s interactions with an interface or system. Feelings and perceptions about an anthropomorphic agent may impact the construction of a mental model about a system, which may lead to inappropriate calibrations of automation trust that is based on an emotional connection with the anthropomorphic agent rather than on actual system performance.},

Because people respond socially to technology and mimicry leads to increased liking of virtual agents, we expected that a mimicking virtual agent would be liked and trusted more than a non-mimicking one. We investigated this expectation in an automotive setting. We performed an experiment in which participants played an investment game and a route planner game, to measure their behavioral trust in two virtual agents. These agents either mimicked participant’s head movements or not. Liking and trust of these virtual agents were measured with questionnaires. Results suggested that for the investment game, mimicry did not increase liking or trust. For the route planner game however, a mimicking virtual agent was liked and trusted more than a non-mimicking virtual agent. These results suggest that mimicry could be a useful tool to persuade users to trust a virtual agent.},

	abstract = {In December 2013, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge (DRC) Trials were held in Homestead, Florida. The DRC Trials were designed to test the capabilities of humanoid robots in disaster response scenarios with degraded communications. Each team created their own interaction method to control their robot, either the Boston Dynamics Atlas robot or a robot built by the team itself. Of the 15 competing teams, eight participated in our study of human-robot interaction. We observed the participating teams from the field (with the robot) and in the control room (with the operators), noting many performance metrics, such as critical incidents and utterances, and categorizing their interaction methods according to the number of operators, control methods, and amount of interaction. We decomposed each task into a series of subtasks, different from the DRC Trials official subtasks for points, to gain a better understanding of each team's performance in varying complexities of mobility and manipulation. Each team's interaction methods have been compared to their performance, and correlations have been analyzed to understand why some teams ranked higher than others. We discuss lessons learned from this study, and we have found in general that the guidelines for human-robot interaction for unmanned ground vehicles still hold true: more sensor fusion, fewer operators, and more automation lead to better performance.},

An automation conundrum exists in which as more autonomy is added to a system, and its reliability and robustness increase, the lower the situation awareness of human operators and the less likely that they will be able to take over manual control when needed. The human–autonomy systems oversight model integrates several decades of relevant autonomy research on operator situation awareness, out-of-the-loop performance problems, monitoring, and trust, which are all major challenges underlying the automation conundrum. Key design interventions for improving human performance in interacting with autonomous systems are integrated in the model, including human–automation interface features and central automation interaction paradigms comprising levels of automation, adaptive automation, and granularity of control approaches. Recommendations for the design of human–autonomy interfaces are presented and directions for future research discussed.},
