\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:intro_overview}
We aim to improve performance and decrease learning times for novice operators of highly complex motor control tasks without increasing cognitive workload.
We are specifically interested in modeling and improving human performance in flight tasks, which generally require extensive training to master.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), for instance, requires a minimum of 1,500 hours as a pilot to captain a U.S. airline~\citep{FAA}.
Being able to decrease this training time could lead to significant savings in cost, and the predictive ability provided by modeling human performance allows for safer operation of aircraft.

A variety of skills can be classified as motor control tasks, such as playing tuba, pole vaulting, or flying an aircraft.
An individual's performance in any of these skills can change dramatically as they transition from a novice to an expert through training.
We are interested in measuring and modeling this performance as it changes over the course of the training process.

Humans rely on several kinds of feedback during training to improve their performance in motor control tasks.
Feedback can be largely grouped into two types: internal, or intrinsic feedback, and external, or extrinsic feedback.
Intrinsic feedback is anything a person can infer using their senses: the feel of the valves of the tuba as you play, the sense of balance mid-jump, or the sound the aircraft engine makes during a climb.
Extrinsic feedback, conversely, is provided by an external source, often in the form of an expert instructor.
Extrinsic feedback comes in a variety of forms, and has a long history of improving performance in a large variety of motor control tasks.

We will focus on a specific type of extrinsic feedback, which is known as concurrent bandwidth feedback (CBF).
Concurrent feedback is provided in real-time, as an operator is completing a task.
Bandwidth feedback is provided when a objective particular value deviates outside a designated range or bandwidth.
Concurrent bandwidth feedback is, therefore, feedback provided to an operator in real-time when a signal deviates out of a predefined range.
This type of feedback has been shown to improve performance in many simple motor control tasks, but has not been investigated in complex, high degree of freedom tasks.

It is important to note that this feedback should be thought of as qualitative feedback, not as an additional form of quantitative guidance.
We are not interested in adding additional displays or gauges to control interfaces, but would prefer to modify existing indicators, during training, to better inform an operator as to how well they are performing a task.
Despite extensive evidence as to the effectiveness of this feedback, the mechanism by which performance is improved has yet to be explained, nor integrated into human performance models.
We will attempt to explain why this feedback is effective in enhancing learning and integrate this explanation into a model.

It is important to carefully consider all aspects of the task when deciding what, when, and how to provide augmented feedback.

\citeauthor{sigrist_augmented_2013} note that ``it seems that the more complex the task, the more the trainee can profit from concurrent feedback.''

% ``Thus, the frequency of feedback should decrease with increasing skill level--that is, with decreasing functional task complexity--to further facilitate motor learning.
% Functional task complexity depends of the current individual skill level and changes during the learning process, whereas nominal task complexity remains invariant.''
It is well established that the frequency of feedback should decrease with increased skill level~\citep{doi:10.3200/JMBR.36.2.212-224, timmermans_technology-assisted_2009, Wulf2002, doi:10.1080/00222899809601335}.
% ``Reduced feedback frequency--that is, fading feedback--seems beneficial for both terminal feedback and concurrent feedback''
It has also been shown that fading feedback, which appears less frequently over time, is beneficial for both terminal and concurrent feedback~\citep{CROWELL201178, KOVACS2011311}
By reducing the frequency of feedback, subjects learn to develop their internal models of the task and identify their own task errors, reducing their dependency of the feedback.

``Bandwidth feedback has been shown to be effective; however, setting the error threshold is not trivial~\citep{sigrist_augmented_2013, timmermans_technology-assisted_2009, RIBEIRO2011231}''.

\citeauthor{sigrist_augmented_2013} states that ``feedback in complex tasks should be prescriptive--that is, feedback should inform the learning on how to correct the error--rather than descriptive (i.e., information about occurrence of an error)'', though we have found that feedback that is purely descriptive can be effective for training complex flight tasks.
Many of the tasks considered by \citeauthor{sigrist_augmented_2013} were targeting specific, short movements or related to sports tasks, however, which do not normally include guidance displays like those found in aerospace tasks.
As these guidance displays are prevalent in the aerospace domain and our subjects were trained in how to use them to accomplish their tasks, it may be that prescriptive feedback is not necessary in this case.
The subjects are already aware of their errors, and the descriptive feedback provided by the concurrent bandwidth feedback simply provides a descriptive of what the most temporally relevant error is.
It has also been suggested that the motor task is relatively simple for flight and driving tasks, and that most of the difficulty associated with the task comes from the high levels of cognitive demand~\citep{doi:10.1080/00222899709600829}.
Under this consideration, simply knowing which error to focus on at any given time may be sufficient for improving performance and could be responsible for the reduction in workload we observed in our previous SAFER study.
In any case, the type of skill and task is certainly ``a critical factor in determining the effectiveness and the appropriateness of the corrective feedback types''~\citep{Tzetzis2008}.

In addition to popularizing the concept of feedback, the creation of control theory in the early 1940s also provided the tools required for the mathematical modeling of the human pilot.
At the time, new weapons were being created for World War 2 which could only be used effectively with trained operators working with a machine.
While it was thought that a human could be viewed as a unique kind of servomechanism in the control feedback loop, it was still unclear what factors affected human performance.
Early work by Tustin and others extended the control theory framework and applied these theories to actual human operators~\citep{tustin1944investigation}.
Particular interest was focused on ``attempt[ing] to find the laws of relationship of movement and error. In particular, it was hoped that this relationship [would] be approximately linear and so permit well developed theory of `linear servomechanisms' to be applied to manual control in the same way as it applies to automatic following~\citep{tustin1944investigation}.''
This would allow for the prediction of human performance and the ability to predict the limits of human control.

These early works were summarized in \citeauthor{mcruer_dynamic_1957}'s report, ``Dynamic Response of Human Operators.''
This work evaluated measurements for single-input/single-output (SISO) manual control systems and developed predictive models consistent with this data.
Indeed, \citeauthor*{mcruer_dynamic_1957} write, ``[i]t is possible, without doing violence to the data, to obtain describing functions which are generally applicable to the results of the many diverse experiments.''
The report concludes by describing a hypothetical transfer function of the human operator which includes a time delay, a neuromuscular lag, and a gain.
McRuer's early model of the complete pilot/vehicle system is presented in Figure~\ref{figure:mcruer1974}.
McRuer revisited these results in \citeyear{mcruer_mathematical_1974}, after three decades of supporting engineering and experimental psychology experiments and was able to further generalize these results to a wide variety of system dynamics.
In his study, McRuer completed a detailed analysis which included the human response to proportional, rate/velocity, and acceleration type controlled element dynamics, see Table~\ref{table:mcruer1974a}.
The result of this report was the now famous ``crossover model,'' which relates the operator and controlled element transfer characteristics by the equation
\begin{align}
    Y_c(jw) Y_p(jw) = \dfrac{w_c e^{-jw \tau_e}}{jw}
\end{align}
where $Y_c$ is the controlled element transfer function, $Y_p$ is the approximate human operator transfer function, $w_c$ is the crossover frequency, and $\tau_e$ is the effective time delay of the pilot.
The crossover model is so named as it allows for linear behavior at approximately -20 dB/decade slope in the region of the crossover frequency.
The approximate human operator response to several controlled element transfer functions and their combined open-loop transfer function are presented in Table~\ref{table:mcruer1974b}.
Modeling the human pilot with the crossover enabled a more complete view of the complete pilot/vehicle system, and allowed for human factors recommendations towards the design of new vehicles.
Even today, the crossover model is used as the standard for describing pilot/vehicle systems at the crossover frequency~\citep{mcruer_human_1965, mcruer_mathematical_1974, xu_review_2017}.

The continued demand for human pilot models for use in informing vehicle design, as well predicting, preventing, and explaining accidents has led to a variety of more complex pilot models since the creation of the crossover model.
A recent review by Xu et al. in 2017 surveyed the state of the art in human pilot modeling and grouped existing models into three classes of models based on: control theory, human physiology, and intelligence techniques~\citep{xu_review_2017}.
Classical models based on control theory include the McRuer crossover model and optimal control models by Kleinman et al. developed in the early 1970s~\citep{kleinman_optimal_1970, baron_optimal_1970}.
Models based on human physiology were developed to understand human pilot perception and control behavior, and include the Hess structural model~\citep{hess_structural_1980, hess_model_1990, hess_unified_1997}, Hosman's descriptive model~\citep{hosman_pilots_nodate, hosman_pilots_1999}, and the biodynamic model~\citep{griffin_validation_2001}.
Recent intelligence models take advantage of techniques including fuzzy control and neural networks~\citep{zaychik_conspectus_2006, gestwa_modelling_2003}.
Of these three overarching sets of models, the models based on human physiology are of the greatest interest here.

\begin{figure}[tb!]

        \label{figure:structuralmodel}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

While the crossover model was very successful in predicting pilot behavior, it it did not attempt ``to describe the underlying structure which contributes to human pilot dynamics~\citep{hess_structural_1980}.''
For this reason, the Hess Structural Model is of particular interest due to the incorporation of multiple sensory channels and models of visual acuity and the time-varying human pilot~\citep{hess_modeling_2009}.
The Structural Model includes the effects of the neuromuscular system, the force-feel characteristics of the input device, and the contributions of proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual feedback, see Figure~\ref{figure:structuralmodel}.
One of the key strengths of the Structural Model is the relatively few number of free parameters that need to be set to predict pilot performance.
The model has been used in predicting and evaluating handling qualities and pilot-induced oscillation rating levels for helicopters, Boeing 747, Lockheed C-5A, and twin ducted-fan aircraft~\citep{hess_analytical_2013, andreea-irina_prediction_2014, grant_handling_2015}.
Hess has also investigated how pilot control characteristics change with time due to flight anomalies, changing flight dynamics, and sudden increases in task demand~\citep{hess_modeling_2009, hess_modeling_2016}.
The results of this model have been compared to the results of a human-in-the-loop simulation for a well trained subject, and showed good comparison~\citep{hess_modeling_2016}.
Recent work from Bachelder et al. has included modifications to the Structural Model to link pilot performance and workload and to enable the modeling of pulsive pilot behavior~\citep{bachelder_modeling_2017, bachelder_linking_2018}.

\subsection{Summary}
Concurrent bandwidth feedback has been used in a large variety of motor control tasks, and has generally been found to improve performance.
Until recently, however, only simple tasks such as physical movements or low-dimensional pursuit tasks have been investigated.
More recent works, including the lane-keeping task by \citeauthor{de_groot_effect_2011}, and our previous work with the SAFER task, have indicated that concurrent bandwidth feedback can also be quite effective for complex tasks~\citep{karasinski_real-time_2017}.
Unlike simple tasks, in which the guidance hypothesis dominates when feedback is removed, there is some evidence that concurrent bandwidth feedback can be removed after training without a loss of performance.
The decrease in required learning time, improved performance, and decreased workload seen in the SAFER task show that concurrent bandwidth feedback may prove to be most useful very early in training when subjects are first exposed to complex, highly dynamic tasks.
As concurrent bandwidth feedback can improve performance without an increase in workload, it may prove a useful technique for training other complex manual control tasks.

There has been considerable improvement in the field of pilot modeling since McRuer's crossover model, especially with models that incorporate human physiology.
The Structural Model, in particular, has been very effective in predicting pilot performance, handling qualities, pilot-induced oscillation rating levels, and workload for a variety of system dynamics.
None of these pilot models, however, are able to include the effects of concurrent bandwidth feedback.
The performance improving effects of this feedback, seen throughout the literature, make this a compelling feature to be incorporated into a pilot model.

This literature review covered the development of the augmented feedback, focusing on examples of concurrent and bandwidth feedback.
Extra focus was spent on cases where augmented feedback techniques were applied to aerospace related tasks.
Additionally, this review covered human performance models applied to piloted aircraft and flight-like tasks.

\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:intro_questions}
We are interested in measuring, modeling, and predicting the effects of concurrent bandwidth feedback (CBF) on human performance in complex manual control tasks.
To this end, this proposed research includes two research aims.
These aims build on each other, starting with a compensatory tracking task, extending to surface electromyography and aircraft flight tasks, and finishing with a theoretical model.

We set out to accomplish two aims with the research included in this dissertation.
This dissertation contains the results of human-in-the-loop subject testing experiments which were designed to understand the effects of concurrent bandwidth feedback.
Using the data from these experiments, the structural model has modified to integrate the effects of this feedback into a human performance model.
To investigate the two Aims outlined below, we completed four experiments and the development of a model.

\begin{description}[align=left]
    \item [Aim One] Investigate the effects of concurrent bandwidth feedback on human performance and workload in complex manual control tasks.
    \item [Aim Two] Extend the Hess Structural Model of the human pilot to include the effects of concurrent bandwidth feedback.
\end{description}

There are a number of research questions that we intend to answer by completing these aims, which include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can concurrent bandwidth feedback improve performance of complex manual control tasks?
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Can CBF reduce the required training time to peak performance?
              \item Can CBF be removed after reaching peak performance without reducing subject performance (i.e., does the guidance hypothesis not hold)?
              \item Does CBF improve performance in transfer of training tasks?
              \item Can performance be increased without increasing workload?
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Can we develop a model of human performance which includes the effects of concurrent bandwidth feedback?
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Can we use this model to estimate operational limits?
          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary}
We have introduced our goals and motivation for the design and use of the concurrent bandwidth feedback, a technique for enhancing motor control training without inducing higher levels of workload.
The background for the experimental work has been described and the open research questions that we explore in this work have been summarized.
In the following chapters, we first present a systematic assessment of current and upcoming human automation/robotic integration technologies and research topics (Chapter~\ref{chapter:tradestudy}), then report on four experiments involving augmented feedback (Chapters~\ref{chap:3dtracking}-\ref{chapter:aircraftfeedback}), propose a theoretical model which explains the observed effects of the feedback (Chapter~\ref{chapter:modeling}), and summarize our findings and proposed future work (Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion}).
