    2.1  & Develop draft criteria and associated weighting for the trade space evaluation of the suitability of each class of technology for each relevant mission task. Among potential decision criteria are: technology readiness, safety-criticality, crew-time savings, unique capability, and minimum frequency of interaction between the human and automation/ robotic system. \\
    2.2  & Work with the HARI DS and other NASA stakeholders to arrive at a consensus for criteria and relative weighting, by participating in a series of virtual meetings, an on-site workshop, or technical interchange meetings as organized and implemented by NASA and KBRwyle.                                                                                                  \\
    2.3  & Develop an analysis method for applying the DS-agreed upon criteria to evaluate each technology for each DRM task, be it computationally
    modeled, empirically data driven or based on subject-matter expertise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\
    2.4  & Complete the trade analysis using the selected analysis method and criteria, and develop recommendations for the most likely automation/ robotic implementations; identify the corresponding human integration design challenges associated with developing each HAR
    system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\
    2.5  & Develop and deliver a final report on the findings, which will include recommendations for each of the HAR tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\
