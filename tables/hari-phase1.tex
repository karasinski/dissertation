    1.1  & Work with the Human Automation / Robotics Integration (HARI) Discipline Scientist (DS) (NASA Civil Servant at Ames) to understand the HAR tasks and the key mission architecture design constraints that will heavily influence future HAR system design. \\
    1.2  & Identify and consider current and near-term future (expected to be operational within the next 10 years) HAR classes of technologies and capabilities that are relevant to the required HAR tasks.                                                        \\
